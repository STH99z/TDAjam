## TDAjam#
### What is TDAjam? ###
"*TDA*" is a reference of "*Touhou Dungeon Adventure*", a touhou fan game I'm currently working at.
This game is half rouge-like, contains adventure and explore features. Pixeled.

Now I have some technical issues with my programing skills so the game is currently limited to a "brawl version", which the "*jam*" stands for.
